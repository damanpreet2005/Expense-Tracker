# Personal Budget and Expense Tracker

A simple command-line program built in C++ to track personal budgets and expenses using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The program allows users to manage multiple budget categories, set spending limits, and add or view expenses within each category.

## Features

- **Add Budget Categories**: Create categories like *Food*, *Rent*, *Transportation*, etc.
- **Set Budgets**: Define spending limits for each category.
- **Add Expenses**: Record detailed expenses with descriptions and amounts.
- **View Reports**: Display budget limits, expenses, and remaining balances for each category.

## How It Works

This project uses **OOP fundamentals** in C++:
- **Classes**:
  - `Expense`: Represents a single expense.
  - `Category`: Manages expenses within a specific budget category.
- **Encapsulation**: Data and methods are encapsulated within relevant classes.
- **Abstraction**: Users interact with high-level functions without worrying about underlying details.
- **Modularity**: The code is organized into reusable and extendable components.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MinGW, or Visual Studio)
